Hi, I'm VNissan @thejniss. I got this account to try and get some help with my twitter. I need help with tech period, though my issues are not just user error which my past would to imply. No matter which device I use. If the device is new, usually takes a day or two before I begin to be limited, (restricted) though on my usual devices, they're coded and adhere to the settings administered by some tech sadists, that have found interests in harassing me. I admit, I've been entertained at times also, but I want them banned. I also want to learn code, basics for now. I am all about twitter. I think twitter's design as a social site for business and brand recruiting is brilliant. I love the cycling contentious feed! I've thought of some additional ways that could substantually affect twitter's profit margin, also attracting more female tech talent. Ugh! They're tormenting me now, as I try to write this. Please help, need to have access to my twitter. Cut off from the media is dangerous for me, they've been my saving grace many times already I think.  Would be wonderful to learn how to override the SOB's who rule my life.  401- My iphone talks 2 me, but I'm not crazy-
